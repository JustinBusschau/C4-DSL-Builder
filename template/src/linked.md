## Linked diagrams

If you want to explicitly control where your diagrams appear in your documetation, the best way to do this is via **Inline diagrams**. Sometimes, however, this is not practical - as is the case when working with diagrams output from the **DSL**. Linking to these diagrams from your documentation, will place them in the correct context.
